  # Command Line README Generator
  
  ## Description
  The purpose of this project was to develop a Node.js application that takes user input from the command line using the Inquirer package and generates a README file. The ability to quickly and easily generate a README file using a command-line application allows project creators to devote more time to developing their project. This project was a component of the Berkeley Fullstack Flex Web Development coding bootcamp.
